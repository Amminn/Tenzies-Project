## Tenzies-Game ðŸŽ²

This game is based on [Scrimba Course](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p5aNKh5 "scrimba"), I did practice and sharp my skills
Using `props` and `useEffect` and many others to create this amazing game.

You can test the game live [here](https://amminn.github.io/Tenzies-Project/ "here")

### About to work on some improvements:
- Add Dice Dotes instead of numbers.
- Add timer to save best timing.
- ~~Add Click counter to save the less Click~~ note Good idea
- Save the data inside Local Storage. *not yet*
